# AlwaysChatGPT
A macOS Menu Bar App, ChatGPT Messenger. "Original" leaked API. SwiftUI

## Description
A light-weight app for iteracting with **ChatGPT without limitations and errors**, using the **leaked API**, it **might not work in future**, but for the moment I'm writing this it works, then I'll do smth, may be.\
Easy access from everywhere, because the app is in Menu Bar, no further updates really needed, everything just works.\
Conversation is **stored between sessions**.

## Usage
- Top left button closes the app
- Key button shows a `SecureField` to enter API Key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Top right button clears the history of conversation

## P. S.
Made this app just for myself and to try `ChatGPT` API, before implementing it in `BetterTG` (my current main pet project)
